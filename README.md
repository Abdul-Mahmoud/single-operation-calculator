# Single Operation 4 Function Calculator <br> 

Basic mobile 4 function calculator that is designed to operate using 2 entered values only. <br>
It features a dynamic UI that can be used in landscape mode.

# How to Run it 
Ensure you have flutter installed on your computer (tested and ran on v2.10.0-0.1.pre) using an android emulator (Pixel 3).
Simply use the command "flutter run" and it will build and install the app on the device connected (emulator or physical phone).

# How it works
When there are no numbers in the equation, the operation buttons are disabled. Similarly, if a user has already enter an operation e.g.
'\*' the operation buttons will also be disabled until the equation has been calculated or cleared using the '=' or 'Clear' buttons.
Once you have calcuated one equation, the equation will reset and you may begin entering numbers again 

# Limitation
- users are only allowed one operation per equation
- equation is reset, so users are incapable of using the answer from previous equation in next equation unless they manual retype it.
- users cannot enter decimal numbers
- only the 4 basic functions of a calculator are implemented
